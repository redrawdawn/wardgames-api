But be careful:\u00A0add the wrong ingredient and the potion could spoil. Do you stop early to\u00A0raise your chance of making a better potion later, or risk a setback to reach for more money and fame now? Finding the right balance between risk and reward is key. \r\n  Winner of the 2018 Gamer  \u0027s Game of the Year in Germany\u00A0  (the Kennerspiel des Jahres - considered the Oscar of boardgames)  ",

      "description_preview": " \r\n Welcome to the world of\u00A0  Santorini  , a fantastic reimagining of the classic abstract game from 2004. Players are given a sandbox in which to play as gods, moving their workers around the board to build up a beautiful, multi-tiered city. Do you have what it takes to outsmart your opponents? Find out, in\u00A0 Santorini ! \r\n \r\n \r\n   Santorini   is a re-imagining of the purely abstract 2004 edition. Since its original inception over 30 years ago, Santorini has been continually developed, enhanced and refined by designer Gordon Hamilton. \r\n Santorini is an accessible strategy game, simple enough for an elementary school classroom while aiming to provide gameplay depth and content for hardcore gamers to explore, The rules are simple. Each turn consists of 2 steps: \r\n  1. Move  - move one of your builders into a neighboring space. You may move your Builder Pawn on the same level, step-up one level, or step down any number of levels. \r\n  2. Build  - Then construct a building level adjacent to the builder you moved. When building on top of the third level, place a dome instead, removing that space from play. \r\n  Winning the game  - If either of your builders reaches the third level, you win. \r\n  Variable player powers  - Santorini features variable player powers layered over an otherwise abstract game, with 40 thematic god and hero powers that fundamentally change the way the game is played. \r\n \r\n \r\n   Turns in\u00A0 Santorini \u00A0are made up of two simple step: Move and Build. Move around the board and build a building in a spot adjacent to one of your workers. The first player to move their worker from a second level building to a third level building wins the game!

You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy\u0027s most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it. Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite!
